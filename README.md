This is an Example App to get an idea of what to build to get the Certificate of Completion for the GJU IT Club [Das Bootcamp](https://it.gju.app/events/bootcamp).


## ðŸ“„ Rules & Instructions
- Create an App that has the following stuff:
  - 2 Main Pages: Home & User
  - **Home**
    - the body is displayed initially with a text instructing the User to add *Gemuse*
    - has a floating action button (FAB) to that opens a dialog (as in screenshots) in which new Gemuse can be added
    - Clicking  on a Page goes to the detailed gemuse page where it displays: name, image, and description
  - **User** (use hardcoded strings)
    - Displays a Profile pic
    - Username
    - email
- Make sure to customize the App by using a custom font for example
- If you wish to improve further than we covered, then feel free to do it
- As always a recording of how this App was built was uploaded to Onedrive (link in discord)
